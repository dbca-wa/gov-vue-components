# gov-vue-components
Repository of common vue components that can be imported into department projects.

See /docs folder for user documentation

To add a vue3 component to this library:

01. Create a virtual environment for node (You can use nodeenv to do that) # TODO: Set up dev container for this repo?
02. Run 'npm install'
03. Copy your component file into the src/components folder
04. Make sure any css definitions are named uniquely as the scoped attribute for the style block does not work when deploying a library
05. Import and export your component in the src/components.js file.
06. Add any images you will need for your documentation to the docs/images folder
07. Create a markdown file in the docs/components folder to document how your component works
08. Add a link to your markdown file in the docs/.vitepress/config.js file
09. Run 'npm run docs:dev' command to preview your documentation locally
10. Once you are happy with everything, run 'npm run docs:build' - This will client and server bundles and render pages for the docs
11. Run 'npm run build' - This will generate a dist folder and the library files (.js, .mjs /assets/.css) or overwrite them if they are already there
12. Increment the version number in the package.json file
13. Do a Pull Request for the new version
14. Once the PR is merged, follow the 'To publish to npm' instructions below to publish the new version to npm.
